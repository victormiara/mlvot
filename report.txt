To code this tracking algorithm, we use some resnet model embeddings for feature extraction, Kalman filtering for predictive tracking, and 
the Hungarian algorithm for data association. 

Pre-trained Deep Learning Model
Model Initialization: A pre-trained ResNet50 model is loaded and set to evaluation mode. This model serves as the backbone for feature extraction.
Image Preprocessing: A series of transformations, including resizing, center cropping, normalization, and conversion to tensor, are defined to 
preprocess input images, making them suitable for feature extraction with the ResNet50 model.
Feature Extraction: The extract_features function extracts 2048-dimensional feature vectors from image patches using the ResNet50 model. This is 
critical for evaluating the similarity between objects across frames, enabling the algorithm to track objects based on appearance.

Kalman Filter
Prediction and Update: The KalmanFilter class implements the predict and update steps of the Kalman filter algorithm, providing estimates of object 
positions and velocities. This predictive capability is essential for tracking objects when they move or when detections are temporarily lost.

Data Association
Cost Matrix Calculation: The update_tracks_with_hungarian function calculates a cost matrix based on the Intersection over Union (IoU) and visual 
feature similarity between predicted object positions and new detections.
Hungarian Algorithm: The linear_sum_assignment function from the SciPy library is used to perform optimal assignment between existing tracks and new 
detections, minimizing the overall cost.

Track Management
Track Initialization and Termination: New tracks are initiated for detections that cannot be matched to existing tracks, and tracks are terminated 
after a predefined number of frames without matching detections. This mechanism helps manage the lifecycle of tracks, starting new ones when necessary 
and removing outdated or irrelevant tracks.

Visualization and Output
Drawing Results: The draw_tracking_results function visualizes the tracking results by drawing bounding boxes and track IDs on the frames.
Saving Tracking Data: The save_tracking_results function outputs the tracking data to a text file, including frame numbers, track IDs, and bounding 
box coordinates.

Main Loop
The main execution loop processes each frame of a video sequence, performing the following steps:
Detection Loading: Detections for the current frame are loaded.
Feature Extraction for New Tracks: For each new detection, features are extracted to facilitate matching based on appearance.

Track Update: Existing tracks are updated with new detections using the Hungarian algorithm, based on both spatial (IoU) and appearance 
(feature similarity) information.
Visualization: The current frame with drawn tracking results is displayed.
Track Management: Unmatched detections initiate new tracks, and tracks without recent updates are terminated.

Conclusion
This tracking algorithm integrates deep learning-based feature extraction with classical tracking methods like the Kalman filter and the Hungarian algorithm. 
It effectively manages tracks through initialization, updating, and termination, balancing spatial and appearance information to track objects across frames. 
The use of a pre-trained deep learning model for feature extraction enhances the algorithm's ability to track objects based on appearance, making it robust against 
occlusions and variations in object appearance.
